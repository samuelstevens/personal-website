# To Do for this Website

This page is both a document for me to keep track of what I want to add/edit/fix, as well as a public roadmap of feature I want to add (so that I'm slightly accountable for my decisions).

## Future Work

- Allow users to add/remove CSS
- Allow users to load images instead of having them automatically loaded (potentially awful for low bandwith users, see Dan Luu's post [here](https://danluu.com/))

## Past Work

- 10/2019: Use CSS variables to manage colors.
