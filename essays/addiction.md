# Addiction

Behavioral addiction is just as real a form of addiction as a substance addiction. It leads to similarly life-changing effects, can cause just as much destruction, but receives significantly less attention, both from the government and an addicts friends and family, typically the first people to notice.

Actions that we take lead to patterns of activity in our brain, as a reward or punishment determined by tens of thousands of years of evolution. Eat a sweet, healthy apple? Your brain fires in a different way than when you stub your toe on the couch. Your brain fires in a certain pattern for when you drink a beer, when a heroin addict gets their latest hit, or when an internet addict loads up Reddit for the 5th time that day. Claire Gillian, a neurologist studying obsessive and repetitive behaviors, explains that, “Drugs and addictive behaviors active the the same reward center in the brain.” However, this means that addictions to behaviors can creep up on us—how can videos of cats produce the same effect in me as a beer to an alcoholic or meth to an addict? 

No behavior is truly addicting until  we develop a physiological dependence on a particular behavior. Adam Alter explains this concisely in Irrestible: “Just as drugs trigger dopamine production, so do behavioral cues.” This mean that when I’m exhausted from a week of travel for work, I want to have a nice meal of home cooked chicken parmesan, and the feeling of relaxation I associate with such a meal is real. When I’ve had a long day, talking to my girlfriend about what went wrong and getting a hug will make all my problems seem smaller. When I’m stressed about emailing a particular professor or my boss, browsing Reddit for 15 minutes makes it seem easier to do such an insurmountable task as…writing an email? 

How can skimming news and memes for 15 minutes be required for me to just write an email? 

I’ve developed an *emotional dependence* on Reddit, and once I noticed this, I saw it everywhere. A little YouTube before homework, a little Reddit before starting an essay, a little Hearthstone before paying attention in class…it was everywhere in my life. 

So behavioral addiction is real, and it comes about as a result of an emotional dependence. Now that I know that I’m addicted, I can kick the addiction and go back to being the focused, driven student I was before. Right?

The hard part is habits, and how we use habits all the time to avoid having to make decisions. The human brain limits energy used, and habits are how we avoid having to think and make conscious decisions. In The Power of Habit, the author describes a habit as:

> cue → routine → reward

Our brains will associate the relationship on a subconscious level: we encounter the cue, and know that performing the routine with lead to the reward. I’m hungry, and I know that eating food will make me feel better. I’m at a bar with friends, and I know that having a beer will make everything seem more fun. I’m bored standing in line, and pulling up Reddit will entertain me.

Except that more often than not, the reward isn’t a high level reward like “having fun” or “being entertained”. It’s much more primal: some dopamine/serotonin/etc will be released into your brain, making you literally feel pleasure. I can rationalize it, but the majority of the rewards just come back to dopamine, which is much, much harder to outthink. Now it becomes clearer that just deciding to **not** do whatever it is, is much harder. 

It turns out that simply **not** doing whatever routine brings about that reward is really hard. We know this—it’s why the number 1 dieting tip is get rid of junk food from your house. It’s clear that if it’s within reach, relying on our own willpower is surefire (for most of us) path to failure. But we (most of us again) can’t get rid of our phones and computers. I’m a computer science major who likes to make mobile apps, for God’s sake. So how can I beat Facebook’s team of super genius engineers looking to make their experience as addictive as possible?

Let’s replace the routine. Studies have shown that not doing something is much easier when there’s something else to do. Drink some orange juice at the bar instead of a beer. Go for a job instead of smoking that cig. Read a book instead of browsing Reddit on the toilet. The cue is the same and the reward is slightly less, but we can form a new, overriding habit.

But what about when I’m studying for an exam and need a break? It’s *so* easy to CTRL-T a new tab, and type “old.reddit.com” before I can consciously think that I should read a book, and by the time I think about the book, there’s a good meme about Javascript that I just **have** to see. What if I had another website that replaced Reddit? If my fingers typed that new website into the search bar, and that website didn’t want to suck me in for hours for more advertising revenue, then maybe I would stand a chance.
