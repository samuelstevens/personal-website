# HealthyAgers

## Full Stack Developer (Lead), Spring 2018 to Fall 2019

### Columbus, Ohio

After participating in the 2018 [Brain Health Hack](https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/neurological-institute/brain-health-and-performance-summit/brain-health-hack), I met [Dr. Ruchika Prakash](https://psychology.osu.edu/people/prakash.30), who was beginning an amazing 5-year study in the effects of mindfulness in aging seniors. She needed two developers to implement the technical component of her study, allowing her to record usage data from study participants automatically, dramatically improving accuracy and quantity of data.
