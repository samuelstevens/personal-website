My roommate couldn't buy a ticket for the [Penn State football game in 2017](https://www.si.com/college-football/2017/10/28/penn-state-ohio-state-analysis-jt-barrett). As a football fan, it was atrocious to me that he didn't get to enjoy that game. We devised a plan to make it easier for Buckeye students to buy and sell tickets to each other. In the process, we discovered that football attendance has been steadily dropping, leading to emptier and emptier stadiums. We set out to make an app that was Buckeye in every way possible, and along with 2 other students, released [TicketBay](https://www.salty.software/ticketbay/download) in August 2018.
