# Day 2: Ham, shredded cheddar and mustard mayo

Toasted white bread with shredded cheddar on both slices, then bundles of ham and mustard mayo.

- I don't think cheddar and ham is a good pairing.
- If I do use shredded cheese, I need a way to melt it more aggressively (toast in the over?).
- Mustard mayo had too much mustard, not enough mayo. I want to try mayo with paprika, or another more spicy flavor.
- Pictures need a larger plain background so that there's nothing in the background.
