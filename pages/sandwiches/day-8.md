# Day 8: Shaved beef and banana peppers on sourdough

Some shaved beef that we had picked up from Kroger. It was not good beef, but the peppers and onions my roommate added were delicious.

- Sourdough was meh.
- The shaved beef was *so* good with banana peppers.
- Onions and bell peppers should be in more sandwiches.
