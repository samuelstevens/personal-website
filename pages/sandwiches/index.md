# 100 Days of Sam-wiches

## Notes

### Sandwich Ideas

- Ham, cultured butter, just a *little* pepper, on a nice French loaf.
- Crusty roll with spicy meats and provolone/mozarella on the bread and olives, spicy peppers, shallots and garlic.
- High quality canned tuna with a little lemon juice, olive oil, pickled onions and (spicy) mayo.
- Seedy bread, smashed seasoned avacode, dressed romaine, pickled vegetables and muenster cheese.
- Toasted ciabatta, lots of ham and butter.

### Topping Ideas

- Mayo, grated garlic, sherry vinegar, smoked paprika, a little salt for a sauce.
- Mayo, dijon mustard, pickled *x* (pickles, peppers, onions, etc.) juice for a good flavored mayo.
- Lightly dress shredded iceberg or romaine lettuce with olive oil and vinegar
- Roasted red bell peppers
- Pesto mayo

### General Tips

- Toast all the bread unless it's amazing quality
- Only toast on one side of the bread for better texture.
- Every cold sandwich should have a couple raw onion rings
