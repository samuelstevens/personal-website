# Day 1: Ham, cheese and onion

Three slices of pepper jack singles, lots of salami and honey ham, onions that were fried in a pan, mayo on the outside of plain white bread.

- Too much cheese.
- Cheese singles are gross, and taste like plastic.
- Onions probably should've been cooked longer.
- Mayo on the outside is *amazing*, so much easier than butter.
- I need to take better pics (a plate would be good).
