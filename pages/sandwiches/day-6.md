# Day 6: Salami, turkey, habanero pepperjack and pickled peppers

Salami, turkey, habanero pepperjack, pimento, banana peppers, sweet relish, and and olive oil, black pepper and salt seasoning.

- Pressing two sandwiches at once is tough. I also probably need to toast both sides of the bread, or flip the sandwich so both sides are toasted/pressed.
- I'm unsure about the combination of sweet relish and spicy pimento/banana peppers. 
- I think turkey is a very plain meat, which is good for bumping the total mass up, but it's overpowered by the salami. I'll go back t ham and salami.
- Natural light for pictures rocks.
