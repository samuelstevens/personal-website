# Day 3: Turkey, ham, havarti and spicy mayo

Toasted italian hero with (slightly) melted havarti, then bundles of ham and turkey with spicy mayo.

- Toasting the hero was the right decision (toast cheap bread)
- Should've added the havarti when I started toasting so it would melt more.
- Spicy mayo with parpika, Tony's creole seasoning, and pickle juice was pretty good.
- Turkey is king.
