# Day 11: Hot dog on a bagel

Sliced smoked sausage, swiss cheese, fried onions and mustard on an everything bagel.

- Lot of competing flavors, but I still really liked it. 
- I would replace the cheap smoked sausage with something like a wurst next time
- Everything bagels are really good at adding flavor, even to something with plenty already.
- Swiss doesn't melt as much.
