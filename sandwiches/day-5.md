# Day 5: Salami, habanero pepperjack and sweet relish press

Salami, habanero pepperjack and sweet relish in an italian hero that was pressed with the lid of a Dutch oven. Seasoned with olive oil, salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder.

- Dutch oven is a perfect press, and pressing a sandwich is phenomenal. I loved it.
- Sweet relish was tasty; I want to experiment more with it.
- Salami is not enough for a sandwich; I definitely need a second meat.
- My photos keep showing up blurry. Maybe I need better lighting, or just a steadier hand?
