# Day 4: Ham, salami, havarti, spicy mayo and pickled pepper spread

Toasted italian hero with melted havarti, then bundles of ham, folded salami, spicy mayo and a pickled pepper spread.

**Pickled pepper spread**: minced garlic, olive oil, banana peppers, diced pimento and Tony's.

- Havarti melts slowly, not much I can do about that besides pick different cheese. Tastes delicious though.
- Spicy mayo had a touch of mustard, no pickle juice. Very good.
- Pickled pepper spread was delicious, and made a big difference.
- Salami was really good, added a different flavor that I didn't expect.
