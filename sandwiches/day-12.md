# Day 12: Three cheese melt with onions and peppers

Three different cheese (provolone, swiss and Munster) on sourdough with onions.

- Pressing a sandwich is very good for making a nice tight sandwich.
- Bread doesn't always need butter/mayo on the outside if I'm feeling like it's too much grease/fat.
