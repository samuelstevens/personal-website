# About Me

[[Resume](/resume.pdf)] [[Email](mailto:samuel.robert.stevens@gmail.com)] [[GitHub](https://github.com/samuelstevens)] 

My name is Sam Stevens. I'm a third year undergrad at THE Ohio State University, where I study Computer Science and minor in German. 

I'm currently (summer 2020) working on my honors undergraduate thesis with [Prof. Wei Xu](https://cocoxu.github.io/) while interning at Microsoft's Seattle office (remotely, due to COVID-19).

I previously worked on [TicketBay](/projects/ticketbay) with [Salty Software](https://salty.software) and [HealthyAgers](/projects/healthyagers) with [Dr Ruchika Prakash](https://psychology.osu.edu/people/prakash.30). 

I've been lucky to intern at GE Aviation (twice!) in Cincinnati and study abroad in Dresden, Germany. 

I (maybe obviously) like [programming](https://github.com/samuelstevens), and cooking (especially [sandwiches](/pages/sandwiches))

# Previous Projects

[TicketBay](/projects/ticketbay): fellow OSU students and I developed a mobile app for Ohio State University students to sell second-hand football tickets.

[HealthyAgers](/projects/healthyagers): a fullstack web application that I led the development of at Ohio State University.

[Airpods](/projects/airpods): a macOS app I published to connect/disconnect from your Airpods quickly.

[ubscrape](/projects/ubscrape): an Urban Dictionary scraper I built, aimed at NLP research.

# Website Pages

[Machine Learning Notes](/pages/machine-learning-notes): Some notes on machine learning. Mostly a glossary of little terms that I want to remember for later on.

[Sam-wiches](/pages/sandwiches): A project to make a bunch of sandwiches. Currently on hold because of COVID-19.
