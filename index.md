# About Me

I'm a third year undergrad at THE Ohio State University, where I study Computer Science and minor in German. 

I previously worked on [TicketBay](/projects/ticketbay) with [Salty Software](https://salty.software) and [HealthyAgers](/projects/healthyagers) with [Dr Ruchika Prakash](https://psychology.osu.edu/people/prakash.30). 

I've been lucky to intern at GE Aviation (twice!) in Cincinnati, study abroad in Dresden, Germany, and will be interning at Microsoft in Seattle this summer (2020).
