# About Me

[[CV](/cv.pdf)] [[Email](mailto:samuel.robert.stevens@gmail.com)] [[GitHub](https://github.com/samuelstevens)]

My name is Sam Stevens. I'm a fourth year undergrad at THE Ohio State University, where I study Computer Science and minor in German.

I'm currently (autumn 2020) working on my honors undergraduate thesis in natural language processing with [Prof. Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io/).

I previously worked on [TicketBay](/projects/ticketbay) with [Salty Software](https://salty.software) and [HealthyAgers](/projects/healthyagers) with [Dr Ruchika Prakash](https://psychology.osu.edu/people/prakash.30).

I've been lucky to intern at GE Aviation (twice!) in Cincinnati, study abroad in Dresden, Germany, and intern at Microsoft remotely.
