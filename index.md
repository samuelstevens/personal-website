# About Me

My name is Sam Stevens. I'm a fourth year undergrad at THE Ohio State University, where I study Computer Science and minor in German.

I'm currently (autumn 2020) working on my honors undergraduate research thesis in natural language processing with [Prof. Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io/).

I'm applying to PhD programs in computer science with a focus on NLP research and looking for research internships and opportunities for the summer of 2021.

I previously worked on [TicketBay](/projects/ticketbay) with [Salty Software](https://salty.software) and [HealthyAgers](/projects/healthyagers) with [Dr Ruchika Prakash](https://psychology.osu.edu/people/prakash.30).

I've been lucky to intern at GE Aviation (twice!) in Cincinnati, study abroad in Dresden, Germany, and intern at Microsoft remotely.

# Behold, My STUFF!

[Social media](http://adamalterauthor.com/irresistible/) [is a real](https://www.nirandfar.com/indistractable/) [problem](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/). This website gives me a creative outlet without the pressure of likes, comments or retweets. I control all the content, all the styling, everything.

This website is my _personal_ website. I'm not a person who takes myself very seriously. So this website doesn't take itself very seriously either. It's my [stuff](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SHbS9tYFpcQ), not my [CV](/cv.pdf).
