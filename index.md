# About Me

My name is Sam Stevens. I'm a Ph.D. student at [THE Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/), where I work in computer science, specifically in natural language processing, with my advisor [Prof. Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io/). I finished my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science at Ohio State in May 2021 (and minored in German).

I've been lucky to intern at SpaceX in Seattle, intern at Microsoft remotely, study abroad in Dresden and intern at GE Aviation (twice) in Cincinnati.

I also previously worked on [TicketBay](/projects/ticketbay) with [Salty Software](https://salty.software) and [HealthyAgers](/projects/healthyagers) with [Dr Ruchika Prakash](https://psychology.osu.edu/people/prakash.30).

# Behold, My STUFF!

[Social media](http://adamalterauthor.com/irresistible/) [is a](https://www.nirandfar.com/indistractable/) [problem](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/). 
This website gives me a creative outlet without the pressure of likes, comments or retweets. 

This website is my _personal_ website. 
I'm not a person who takes myself very seriously. 
So this website doesn't take itself very seriously either. 
It's my [stuff](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SHbS9tYFpcQ), not my [CV](/cv.pdf).
