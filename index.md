# I'm Sam.

I write code and work on little tools in my spare time. I like speaking German. I'm a big fan of lifting weights and running. I play water polo. Some of my code and interesting stuff is in links below.

I write a little bit about my thoughts and experiences. Some friends and I do projects as well. Those are on the right.
