- Testing vs Typing: type checking is especially beneficial when you control all of the code, because then you can add types to all of the code and ensure it works correct internally. Testing is better when you are interfacing with external code; even if your code passes type checks, the external code might not.
- Unix tools: fzf, rg, fd, sed, tmux
